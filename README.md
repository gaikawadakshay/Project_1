### 5. **Testing Tools and Technologies**

Describe the tools, technologies, and frameworks used in the testing process. Include any automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress), testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, TestNG), continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins), and reporting tools (e.g., Allure, TestRail).


## Testing Tools and Technologies

```- Testing Framework:** JUnit 5 / TestNG (for Java-based tests)```
```- Automation Tools:** Selenium WebDriver, Cypress (for automated UI testing)```
```- Performance Testing Tool:** Apache JMeter (for load and performance testing)```
- Bug Tracking: Jira (for defect management)```
```Test Reports: Allure, ExtentReports```
Continuous Integration: Jenkins```

## Test Plan

This testing project follows the **STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)** with the following stages:

- **Test Planning:** Creating the test strategy, test cases, and assigning resources.
- **Test Design:** Designing the detailed test cases and creating test data.
- **Test Execution:** Running the test cases and logging defects.
- **Defect Reporting:** Tracking defects using Jira.
- **Test Closure:** Finalizing the test execution, generating reports, and obtaining sign-off.

Test cases will be executed in the following areas:
- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing
- Load Testing
- Security Testing
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

## Test Cases

Test cases are organized by functionality and can be found in the `test_cases` directory. Each test case follows this structure:

- Test Case ID
- Test Scenario
- Test Case Description
- Test Steps
- Expected Result
- Actual Result
- Status (Pass/Fail)

To add new test cases:
1. Go to the `test_cases` folder.
2. Follow the template to create new test cases.

Example Test Case:

Test Case ID: TC001
Test Scenario:Login Functionality
Description: Verify login functionality with valid credentials.
Test Steps:
1. Open the login page.
2. Enter valid username and password.
3. Click the login button.
Expected Result: User should be redirected to the dashboard page.
Actual Result: (To be filled after execution)
Status: (Pass/Fail)
